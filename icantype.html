	    <p>Here are a few benefits of typing skills: <br>

Productivity
A person who is at ease using a keyboard is significantly more productive. Consequently, more time is saved. Employers favor productive workers, or those who can do more work in a short time.

While highly experienced typists can work at a speed above 120 wpm, the average professional typist typically has a rate of 50 to 80 wpm. A typing speed of 50 to 60 wpm is an adequate goal that’s doable if you’re not a professional typist but work mainly on a computer.<br>

Health improvement
Have you ever witnessed your mom or grandparents lowering themselves over a keyboard in an effort to find the appropriate keys? Given that they didn’t grow up using computers, we can’t hold it against them.

Our generation was fortunate to have computer classes when we were young, which gave us early touch-typing practice. Nevertheless, by learning how to type fast and accurate, you can significantly lower occupational health concerns like poor posture and RSI (repetitive strain injury).<br>

Easy employment
A person who is at ease using a keyboard can swiftly make changes and corrections to any text. This skill is beneficial for businesses of any size, especially those dealing with data entry.

Although most job seekers may not list their “superior typing skills” on their resumes, it’s a reality that having good typing skills might give you that much-needed competitive edge in the job market today and in the future. Simply put, those who are competent at communicating effectively with the help of current tools and motivated to improve continually are already ahead of the game. Being a keyboard master, after all, denotes solid technological competence, which is essential if you wish to succeed in these extremely fast-paced, competitive times.<br>

Efficiency
A speedy typist can also understand the materials that need to be input. They are quicker and easier at retaining information, which increases their productivity and, more importantly, their work quality.

Consider the numerous documents and emails you must type each day. How wonderful would it be able to finish them much faster?<br>

Proficiency in other programs
Software like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Keynote, and alike all require some typing. Without a firm grasp of the keyboard, becoming proficient in any of these programs is impossible. What is the simplest way to achieve typing improvement, then? Read on to find out!<br>

		There is a distinction between “touch-typing” and just pressing letters with some of your fingers.
		Touch-typing is a typing technique that involves using all one’s fingers to type while not glancing at the keys.
		And identifying which one is more effective doesn’t need much brain power.
		A touch-typist can do more tasks in less time, which helps improve productivity at the workplace.
